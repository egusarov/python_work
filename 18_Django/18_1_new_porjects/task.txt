18-1. New Projects: To get a better idea of what Django does, build a couple 
empty projects and look at what Django creates. Make a new folder with a simple 
name, like tik_gram or insta_tok (outside of your learning_log directory), 
navigate to that folder in a terminal, and create a virtual environment. 
Install Django and run the command django-admin.py startproject tg_project . 
(making sure to include the dot at the end of the command).
Look at the files and folders this command creates, and compare them to Learning 
Log. Do this a few times, until youâ€™re familiar with what Django creates when 
starting a new project. Then delete the project directories if you wish.
