16-6. Refactoring: The loop that pulls data from all_eq_dicts uses variables for 
the magnitude, longitude, latitude, and title of each earthquake before 
appending these values to their appropriate lists. This approach was chosen for 
clarity in how to pull data from a GeoJSON file, but itâ€™s not necessary in your 
code. Instead of using these temporary variables, pull each value from eq_dict 
and append it to the appropriate list in one line. Doing so should shorten the 
body of this loop to just four lines.
