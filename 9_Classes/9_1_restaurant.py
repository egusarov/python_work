# 9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant.
# The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type.
# Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information,
# and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.
# Make an instance called restaurant from your class.
# Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.
