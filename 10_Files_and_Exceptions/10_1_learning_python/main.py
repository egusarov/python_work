# 10-1. Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines
# summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line with the
# phrase In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same
# directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the file
# and prints what you wrote two times: print the contents once by reading in the
# entire file, and once by storing the lines in a list and then looping over each line.
