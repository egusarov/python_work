20-4. Extended Learning Log: Add one feature to Learning Log, and push 
the change to your live deployment. Try a simple change, such as writing more 
about the project on the home page. Then try adding a more advanced feature, 
such as giving users the option of making a topic public. This would require 
an attribute called public as part of the Topic model 
(this should be set to False by default) and a form element on the new_topic 
page that allows the user to change a topic from private to public. 
You’d then need to migrate the project and revise views.py so any topic that’s 
public is visible to unauthenticated users as well.
