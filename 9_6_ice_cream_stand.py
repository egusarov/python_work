# 9-6. Ice Cream Stand: An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. Write
# a class called IceCreamStand that inherits from the Restaurant class you wrote in
# Exercise 9-1 (page 162) or Exercise 9-4 (page 166). Either version of the class
# will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an attribute called flavors that
# stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that displays these flavors.
# Create an instance of IceCreamStand, and call this method.
