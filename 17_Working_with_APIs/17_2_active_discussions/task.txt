17-2. Active Discussions: Using the data from hn_submissions.py, make a bar
chart showing the most active discussions currently happening on Hacker News.
The height of each bar should correspond to the number of comments each submission
has. The label for each bar should include the submissionâ€™s title and act
as a link to the discussion page for that submission. If you get a KeyError when
creating a chart, use a try-except block to skip over the promotional posts.
