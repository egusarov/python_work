14-1. Press P to Play: Because Alien Invasion uses keyboard input to control the
ship, it would be useful to start the game with a keypress. Add code that lets the
player press P to start. It might help to move some code from _check_play_button()
to a _start_game() method that can be called from _check_play_button() and
_check_keydown_events().
