14-2. Target Practice: Create a rectangle at the right edge of the screen that
moves up and down at a steady rate. Then on the left side of the screen, create
a ship that the player can move up and down while firing bullets at the
rectangular target. Add a Play button that starts the game, and when the player
misses the target three times, end the game and make the Play button reappear.
Let the player restart the game with this Play button.
