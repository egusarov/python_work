14-6. Refactoring: Look for methods that are doing more than one task, and
refactor them to organize your code and make it efficient. For example, move
some of the code in _check_bullet_alien_collisions(), which starts a new
level when the fleet of aliens has been destroyed, to a function called start
_new_level(). Also, move the four separate method calls in the __init__() method
in Scoreboard to a method called prep_images() to shorten __init__(). The prep
_images() method could also help simplify _check_play_button() or start_game()
if youâ€™ve already refactored _check_play_button().
